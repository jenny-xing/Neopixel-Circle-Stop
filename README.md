Neopixel Circle Stop
===========

This is a hardware version of the mobile game Circle Stop made by twenty percent games (available on the Google Play Store and the App Store): http://www.twentypercentgames.com/circlestop
It was made using hardware from Electric Imp and a Adafruit Neopixel ring and programmed in Squirrel during Pearl Hacks 2014.

it's a one-button game where you need to press the button when your player collides with the yellow pixel to score a point. the yellow pixel then jumps to a random spot.
